# Hazel
Hazel (short for hazelnut) is a framework for conveniently creating GUIs within Brux.
# Why?
When I decided to start working on Exploria (a file explorer within Brux), I noticed that I'd have to introduce the same aspects for GUIs multiple times.
On top of that, there would be a chance that said aspects may not be backwards compatible between version.
