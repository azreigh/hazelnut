# Hazel
Hazel (short for hazelnut) is a framework for conveniently creating GUIs within Brux.
# Why?
To put it simply, I had 2 projects that shared the same code for certain GUI aspects

As a result, I've decided to work on a more general solution that includes all of these aspects.
# Todos
- [ ] Basic widget implementation
- [X] Initial theme support
- [ ] Qt Framework-like Layouts
- [X] Child system
- [ ] Godot-like scene system
